###GENERAL IDEAS
- "person was here", or "person is that"
- difference between generic "retrieval" and the specific one (ex: based on query)
- extract relations, defining the strongest one (by mean of reinforcing its value for each
founded same entry) or finding contradiction (with percentage of validity/strength) 
- filter sentences before processing based on some param (e.g. person)
- "Pagerank": return most important entity of the text based on the number on relations to it
- filter triplets by classification (Person, Place ect.)
- construct knowledge base, level of confidence with the validity of something
